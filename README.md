- **Photo Fetching**: Images are sourced from the Unsplash API, providing high-quality random photos.
- **Image Interaction**:
  - Hovering over an image reveals a description.
  - Clicking on an image redirects users to the Unsplash website, where they can view the author and download the photo.
- **Custom Loading Animation**: A visually appealing loading animation enhances user experience while images are being fetched.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience across all screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To use the Infinite Scroll app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Unsplash API Key**: You need to sign up for an account on Unsplash to obtain your access key. Visit [Unsplash API Documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation) for more details.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/infinite-scroll.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd infinite-scroll
   ```
3. Replace the placeholder access key in the code with your own Unsplash API key.

## Dependencies

- **Google Fonts**: The app uses the Doto font for a clean and modern look.

## Future Scope

To enhance performance and user experience, implementing the following features is worth consideration:

- **Initial Image Load Optimization**: Load fewer images initially and progressively load additional images as needed to reduce network resource consumption.
- **User Customization Options** : Allow users to filter images by categories or tags.
- **Offline Support**: Implement caching mechanisms to allow users to view previously loaded images without an internet connection.
- **Enhanced Image Metadata**: Provide more detailed information about each photo, including camera settings and location data.
